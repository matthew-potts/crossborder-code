The near continuous decline in value was only arrested due to expansionary fiscal policy, namely the July unveiling of the 'Big Beautiful Bill'."

As global uncertainty spiked, global investors with dollar exposures bought hedges on an ex post basis, contributing to USD weakness. This has little implication for the dollar's role as a global safe asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, as with any statistic, it's worth being cautious about extrapolating out correlations calculated in a period of relative stability to the potential future scenario of a global financial crisis. A catastrophically sharp correction in U.S. equity markets that spills over to wider financial system would mark a structural break in the dynamics governing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, foreign capital did not actually flock en masse to the U.S. at the height of the GFC 2007-08 - [something which I've already discussed](https://www.crossbordercode.com/research/U.S.Assets.DuringGFC/U.S.Assets.During.Crisis.html). So there's perhaps no reason to think that the dynamics of a potential crisis would be hugely different from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the above does indeed illustrate, however, is how U.S. policy uncertainty can cause noticeable shifts in previously well-founded and established rules in international finance.\n",
